/**
 * Provides abstract classes for services related to biogeochemistry and freshwaters in the Pandora system. These
 * classes define abstractions for handling CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on objects within a map-based
 * context, as well as generating hash codes for entities based on specific properties.
 *
 * <p>
 * The package includes the following classes:
 * </p>
 * <ul>
 * <li>{@link com.science.earth.biogeochemistry.freshwaters.pandora.general.objects.services.
 * abstractions.classes.AbstractMapCrudService}: An abstract class implementing CRUD operations using a map-based
 * storage.</li>
 * <li>{@link com.science.earth.biogeochemistry.freshwaters.pandora.general.objects.services.
 * abstractions.classes.AbstractHashMapService}: An abstract class providing a method for generating hash codes based on
 * a {@code Cell} and {@code LocalDateTime}.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>
 * These abstractions are designed to be extended and implemented in specific contexts within the Pandora system for
 * managing and manipulating data related to biogeochemistry in freshwater environments.
 * </p>
 *
 * @see com.science.earth.biogeochemistry.freshwaters.pandora.general.objects.services.abstractions.
 * interfaces.CrudService The interface defining CRUD operations.
 * @see java.util.HashMap The Java standard library class providing a map-based storage implementation.
 * @see java.util.Objects The Java standard library class providing utility methods for operating on objects.
