/**
 * Provides the main entry point for the Pandora Cell Tool application, a
 * command-line tool designed to execute and manage calculation processes using
 * the Spring framework.
 *
 * <p>
 * The {@code PandoraCellTool} class handles the application lifecycle by
 * loading the Spring application context, preprocessing input parameters,
 * performing calculations, and post-processing the results.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * This package relies on the {@code com.pandora.calculation} sub-packages to
 * provide services for bootstrapping, command-line parsing, and calculation
 * execution.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * Logging is handled through the SLF4J framework to track key events during the
 * application's execution.
 * </p>
