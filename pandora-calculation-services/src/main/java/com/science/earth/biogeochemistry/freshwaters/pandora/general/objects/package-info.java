/**
 * This package contains classes representing various objects used in the Pandora biogeochemical model for freshwater
 * systems. These objects include base objects, cells, cell timesteps, Pandora timesteps, differential equations, and
 * other related entities.
 * <p>
 * The key classes in this package are:
 * <ul>
 * <li>{@link com.science.earth.biogeochemistry.freshwaters.pandora.general.objects.AbstractBaseObject}: An abstract
 * base class for common properties of Pandora model objects.</li>
 * <li>{@link com.science.earth.biogeochemistry.freshwaters.pandora.general.objects.Cell}: Represents a geographical
 * cell in the Pandora model with attributes such as center coordinates, surface area, and next cell identifier.</li>
 * <li>{@link com.science.earth.biogeochemistry.freshwaters.pandora.general.objects.CellTimestep}: Represents a time
 * step associated with a geographical cell, including initial and final states, and timestamps.</li>
 * <li>{@link com.science.earth.biogeochemistry.freshwaters.pandora.general.objects.PandoraDifferentialEquations}:
 * Implements the FirstOrderDifferentialEquations interface for solving differential equations in the Pandora
 * model.</li>
 * <li>{@link com.science.earth.biogeochemistry.freshwaters.pandora.general.objects.PandoraTimestep}: Represents a time
 * step in the Pandora model with attributes such as initial values, time range, and sources.</li>
 * <li>{@link com.science.earth.biogeochemistry.freshwaters.pandora.general.objects.River}: Represents a river in the
 * Pandora model with a list of independent cell sets associated with it.</li>
 * <li>{@link com.science.earth.biogeochemistry.freshwaters.pandora.general.objects.RiverTimestep}: Represents a time
 * step associated with a river, containing a list of independent cell timesteps.</li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * The classes in this package are designed to model and support the simulation of biogeochemical processes in
 * freshwater systems using the Pandora model.
