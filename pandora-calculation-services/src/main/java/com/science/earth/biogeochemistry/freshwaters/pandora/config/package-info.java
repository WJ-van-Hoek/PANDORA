/**
 * The {@code com.science.earth.biogeochemistry.freshwaters.pandora.config.species} package contains classes and
 * interfaces related to the configuration and management of biogeochemical species in the Pandora biogeochemical model.
 * This package includes implementations of specific species, abstractions for common functionality, and services for
 * handling species configurations.
 * <p>
 * The main components in this package are:
 * <li>{@link com.science.earth.biogeochemistry.freshwaters.pandora.config.species.DOC} and
 * {@link com.science.earth.biogeochemistry.freshwaters.pandora.config.species.DIC}: Classes representing specific
 * biogeochemical species (Dissolved Organic Carbon and Dissolved Inorganic Carbon) with configured properties such as
 * name, unit, molar mass, and oxidation rate.</li> This package contributes to the configuration and behavior of
 * biogeochemical species within PANDORA, supporting modular and extensible management of various species in a
 * freshwater system.
