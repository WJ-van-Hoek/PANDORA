/**
 * This package contains the main entry point for the Pandora Calculation Spring Boot application. The application is
 * designed for freshwater biogeochemistry calculations, particularly focusing on particle and sediment dynamics in
 * fluid environments.
 * <p>
 * The primary class in this package is
 * {@link com.science.earth.biogeochemistry.freshwaters.pandora.PandoraCalculation}, which serves as the entry point for
 * the Spring Boot application. It utilizes the {@code @SpringBootApplication} annotation to enable auto-configuration
 * and component scanning, providing a streamlined setup for the application.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * The application can be launched by executing the {@code main} method in the
 * {@link com.science.earth.biogeochemistry.freshwaters.pandora.PandoraCalculation} class. This method internally
 * utilizes {@code SpringApplication.run} to start the Spring Boot application, initializing the necessary components
 * and triggering the Spring Boot lifecycle.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * The package encapsulates functionality related to biogeochemistry calculations and provides a modular structure for
 * potential extensions and additional features in the context of freshwater research.
 * </p>
