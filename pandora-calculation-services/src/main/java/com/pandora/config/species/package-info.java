/**
 * The {@code com.pandora.config.species} package contains classes and interfaces related to the configuration and
 * management of biogeochemical species in the Pandora biogeochemical model. This package includes implementations of
 * specific species, abstractions for common functionality, and services for handling species configurations.
 * <p>
 * The main components in this package are:
 * <p>
 * {@link com.pandora.config.species.DOC DOC} and {@link com.pandora.config.species.DIC DIC} represent specific
 * biogeochemical species with configured properties such as name, unit, molar mass, and oxidation rate.
 * <p>
 * This package contributes to the configuration and behavior of biogeochemical species within PANDORA, supporting
 * modular and extensible management of various species in a freshwater system.
