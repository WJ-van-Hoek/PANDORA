/**
 * This package contains service interfaces and implementations for managing specie configurations.
 * <p>
 * The {@code SpecieConfigurationMemoryService} interface defines methods for storage operations on specie
 * configurations. Implementing classes are expected to provide concrete implementations to interact with a repository
 * for managing specie configurations.
 * <p>
 * The {@code SpecieConfigurationMemoryServiceImpl} class implements the
 * {@link com.pandora.calculation.services.SpecieConfigurationMemoryService} interface to provide CRUD (Create, Read,
 * Update, Delete) operations for specie configurations. This service class uses a
 * {@link java.util.concurrent.ConcurrentHashMap} to store specie configurations, ensuring thread safety and efficient
 * concurrent access.
