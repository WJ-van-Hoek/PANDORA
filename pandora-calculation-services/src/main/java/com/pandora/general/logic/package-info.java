/**
 * Provides classes and interfaces related to general logic in the context of freshwater biogeochemistry within the
 * Pandora project.
 * <p>
 * The classes in this package include logic implementations for sediment transport coefficients and shear stress
 * calculations, crucial in understanding erosion and sedimentation processes in freshwater ecosystems.
 * <p>
 * This package follows the Spring Framework's convention and includes Spring components, such as
 * {@link org.springframework.stereotype.Component} annotated classes, for integration into larger applications that
 * leverage dependency injection and component scanning.
 * <p>
 * The key interfaces in this package are:
 * <ul>
 * <li>{@link com.pandora.general.logic.ErosionLogic}</li>
 * <li>{@link com.pandora.general.logic.ShearStressLogic}</li>
 * </ul>
 * These interfaces define methods for calculating sediment transport coefficients and shear stress parameters relevant
 * to freshwater biogeochemistry studies.
