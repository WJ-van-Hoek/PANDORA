/**
 * This package contains implementations of map-based CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) services in the Pandora
 * application. These services use a {@code Map} as the underlying data structure for managing entities. The package
 * includes an abstract base class
 * {@link com.pandora.services.mapcrudservices.
 * implementations.AbstractMapCrudService}
 * that provides a generic implementation for CRUD operations using a {@code Map}.
 * <p>
 * The key classes/interfaces in this package are:
 * <ul>
 * <li>{@link com.pandora.services.mapcrudservices.
 * implementations.AbstractBaseMapCrudService}:
 * An abstract class extending {@code AbstractMapCrudService} and adding functionality specific to entities extending
 * {@link com.pandora.general.objects.AbstractBaseObject}. It includes methods
 * for saving or updating entities and managing unique identifiers for entities without an ID.</li>
 * <li>{@link com.pandora.services.mapcrudservices.
 * implementations.AbstractMapCrudService}:
 * An abstract base class providing a generic implementation of the
 * {@link com.pandora.services.crudservices.interfaces.CrudService} interface
 * for map-based CRUD operations. It uses a {@code Map} as the underlying data structure.</li>
 * <li>{@link com.pandora.services.mapcrudservices.
 * implementations.MapService}:
 * An interface defining a method to clean the map, resetting or removing entries to achieve a clean state. Implementing
 * classes may provide specific actions during the cleaning process.</li>
 * </ul>
 * </p>
 * These implementations offer a flexible and reusable way to perform CRUD operations on entities using a map-based
 * approach in the Pandora project.
