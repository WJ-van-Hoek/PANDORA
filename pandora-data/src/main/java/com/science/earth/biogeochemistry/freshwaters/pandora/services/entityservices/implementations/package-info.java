/**
 * This package contains implementations of entity services for managing entities in the Pandora project. Entity
 * services provide common functionality for interacting with entities extending
 * {@link com.pandora.model.AbstractBaseDBEntity}.
 *
 * <p>
 * These services handle operations such as null checks, determining if an entity is new, and retrieving information
 * about the generic type of the entities.
 *
 * <p>
 * Classes in this package extend
 * {@link com.pandora.services.entityservices.interfaces.
 * AbstractBaseEntityService},
 * providing concrete implementations for specific entity types.
 *
 * <p>
 * Concrete implementations are expected to define additional functionality for their specific use cases. The base
 * functionality is provided by the abstract class
 * {@link com.pandora.services.entityservices.interfaces.
 * AbstractBaseEntityService},
 * which itself extends {@link org.springframework.stereotype.Service}.
 *
