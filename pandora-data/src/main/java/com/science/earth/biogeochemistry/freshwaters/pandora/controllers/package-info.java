/**
 * This package contains classes related to controllers in the Pandora application. Controllers handle incoming HTTP
 * requests, process them, and return appropriate responses.
 * <p>
 * The key class in this package is:
 * <ul>
 * <li>{@link com.science.earth.biogeochemistry.freshwaters.pandora.controllers.CellCrudController}: A controller
 * responsible for handling CRUD operations related to
 * {@link com.science.earth.biogeochemistry.freshwaters.pandora.model.CellDBEntity} instances. It includes methods to
 * handle HTTP GET requests for finding cells by their IDs.</li>
 * </ul>
 * </p>
 * Controllers act as the entry point for HTTP requests and facilitate communication between the client and the backend
 * services. They utilize services such as
 * {@link com.science.earth.biogeochemistry.freshwaters.pandora.services.crudservices.
 * interfaces.CellDBEntityCrudService}
 * for performing CRUD operations on cell entities.
