/**
 * This package contains Spring Data repositories for accessing and managing database entities in the Pandora project.
 * Repositories define methods for common database operations such as saving, retrieving, and deleting entities.
 *
 * <p>
 * The main interfaces in this package are based on Spring Data's
 * {@link org.springframework.data.repository.CrudRepository}, providing standard CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete)
 * functionality.
 *
 * <p>
 * Specific repositories, such as
 * {@link com.science.earth.biogeochemistry.freshwaters.pandora.repositories.AbstractBaseDBEntityRepository} and
 * {@link com.science.earth.biogeochemistry.freshwaters.pandora.repositories.CellDBEntityRepository}, extend the base
 * repositories and define methods for working with entities of specific types.
