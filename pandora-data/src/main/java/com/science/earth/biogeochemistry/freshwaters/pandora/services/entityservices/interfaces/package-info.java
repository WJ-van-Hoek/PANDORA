/**
 * This package contains interfaces defining common functionality for services operating on entities in the Pandora
 * project. Entity services provide methods for null checks, determining if an entity is new, and retrieving information
 * about the generic type of the entities.
 *
 * <p>
 * The main interface in this package is
 * {@link com.science.earth.biogeochemistry.freshwaters.pandora.services.entityservices.interfaces.
 * AbstractBaseEntityService},
 * which provides a contract for services managing entities extending
 * {@link com.science.earth.biogeochemistry.freshwaters.pandora.model.AbstractBaseDBEntity}.
 *
 * <p>
 * Implementations of these interfaces are expected to provide specific functionality for managing entities of a
 * particular type.
