/**
 * The objects package contains classes representing entities with configuration, data and logic. These classes
 * encapsulate the state and behavior of various entities within the PANDORA calculation.
 *
 * Classes within this package are designed to provide a structured way to model real-world or abstract entities,
 * allowing for easy manipulation of their data and execution of their behavior.
 *
 * These classes follow object-oriented principles such as encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism to provide a
 * flexible and maintainable way to work with entities in the system.
