## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
**Java Development Kit (JDK):**
PANDORA requires JDK 17 or later. You can download the JDK from [Oracle](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/).

`java --version`

**Apache Maven:**
Install Maven by downloading it from the [official Apache Maven website](https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi). 
- To check your version of maven run the following in your terminal:
`mvn -v`

**Integrated Development Environment (IDE):**
Choose a Java IDE that supports Maven, such as [Eclipse](https://www.eclipse.org/), [IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/), or [Spring Tool Suite](https://spring.io/tools).

**Git:**
Git is used for version control. Install Git from [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com/).
- To check your version of git run the following in your terminal:
`git --version`


### Development setup
1. Navigate to your workspace in your terminal
2. Clone the PANDORA repository
`git clone https://github.com/WJ-van-Hoek/PANDORA.git`
3. Import the PANDORA maven project in your IDE

### Reporting Bugs

If you encounter any issues or bugs while using our Spring project, we appreciate your help in improving the software. To ensure effective bug reporting, please follow these guidelines:

1. **Search for Duplicates:**
   - Before reporting a new bug, please check the existing issues to see if the problem has already been reported. If it has, feel free to add any additional information or context in the existing thread.

2. **Provide Clear and Detailed Information:**
   - When creating a new bug report, include a clear and concise title that summarizes the issue. In the description, provide detailed steps to reproduce the bug, including any relevant code snippets, configurations, or input data.

3. **Environment Information:**
   - Specify the environment details where the issue occurred:
      - Operating System: [e.g., Windows 10, Ubuntu 20.04]
      - Browser (if applicable)

4. **Error Messages and Logs:**
   - Include any error messages, stack traces, or log outputs related to the issue. This information is crucial for understanding the root cause of the problem.

5. **Screenshots or Videos (if applicable):**
   - If the issue is related to the web interface, consider attaching screenshots or videos that demonstrate the problem. Visual aids can significantly speed up the debugging process.

6. **Expected vs. Actual Behavior:**
   - Clearly describe what you expected to happen and what actually happened. This helps in understanding the desired functionality and identifying any deviations.

7. **Additional Context:**
   - Provide any additional context or information that might be relevant to the issue. This could include specific use cases, browser details (if applicable), or any workarounds you've attempted.

8. **Labeling:**
   - Help us categorize and prioritize the issue by applying relevant labels (e.g., bug, enhancement, help wanted) when creating the bug report.

Thank you for contributing to the improvement of PANDORA! We will review your bug report as soon as possible.


### Suggesting Enhancements

We welcome contributions and suggestions for enhancing PANDORA. If you have ideas for new features or improvements, please follow these guidelines to ensure a smooth and constructive enhancement proposal:

1. **Search for Existing Enhancements:**
   - Before suggesting a new enhancement, check if a similar proposal already exists in the project's issues. If it does, you can contribute by adding your thoughts and feedback to the existing discussion.

2. **Clearly Define the Enhancement:**
   - Provide a clear and detailed description of the enhancement you are suggesting. Clearly articulate the problem or limitation you are addressing and how your proposed enhancement would improve the project.

3. **Use Descriptive Titles:**
   - Choose a title that succinctly summarizes the proposed enhancement. A descriptive title makes it easier for others to understand the nature of the suggestion.

4. **Provide Use Cases:**
   - Include real-world use cases or scenarios that demonstrate why the suggested enhancement would be beneficial. This helps in understanding the practical implications and potential impact on users.

5. **Consider Compatibility:**
   - If applicable, discuss how the enhancement may affect existing features or compatibility with other components. Consider backward compatibility and provide recommendations for migration if necessary.

6. **Optional: Include Design or Implementation Details:**
   - If you have specific design or implementation ideas for the enhancement, feel free to include them. While detailed technical proposals are not mandatory, they can provide valuable insights for developers.

7. **Labeling:**
   - Help categorize your enhancement proposal by applying relevant labels (e.g., enhancement, feature request) when creating the issue.

8. **Discussion and Feedback:**
   - Be open to discussions and feedback from the community. Engage with contributors who show interest in your enhancement proposal and consider their perspectives to refine and improve the suggestion.

9. **Be Patient:**
   - Understand that the enhancement proposal may take time to be reviewed and accepted. Be patient and open to iterative discussions as the proposal evolves.

Thank you for taking the time to contribute to the improvement of PANDORA. Your suggestions and enhancements are valuable in making the project better for everyone.
