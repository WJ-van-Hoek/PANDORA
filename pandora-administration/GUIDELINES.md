### Reporting Bugs

If you encounter any issues or bugs while using our Spring project, we appreciate your help in improving the software. To ensure effective bug reporting, please follow these guidelines:

1. **Search for Duplicates:**
   - Before reporting a new bug, please check the existing issues to see if the problem has already been reported. If it has, feel free to add any additional information or context in the existing thread.

2. **Provide Clear and Detailed Information:**
   - When creating a new bug report, include a clear and concise title that summarizes the issue. In the description, provide detailed steps to reproduce the bug, including any relevant code snippets, configurations, or input data.

3. **Environment Information:**
   - Specify the environment details where the issue occurred:
      - Operating System: [e.g., Windows 10, Ubuntu 20.04]
      - Browser (if applicable)

4. **Error Messages and Logs:**
   - Include any error messages, stack traces, or log outputs related to the issue. This information is crucial for understanding the root cause of the problem.

5. **Screenshots or Videos (if applicable):**
   - If the issue is related to the web interface, consider attaching screenshots or videos that demonstrate the problem. Visual aids can significantly speed up the debugging process.

6. **Expected vs. Actual Behavior:**
   - Clearly describe what you expected to happen and what actually happened. This helps in understanding the desired functionality and identifying any deviations.

7. **Additional Context:**
   - Provide any additional context or information that might be relevant to the issue. This could include specific use cases, browser details (if applicable), or any workarounds you've attempted.

8. **Labeling:**
   - Help us categorize and prioritize the issue by applying relevant labels (e.g., bug, enhancement, help wanted) when creating the bug report.
