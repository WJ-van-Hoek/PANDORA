# PANDORA

Welcome to the PANDORA open-source repository! Thank you for your interest and potential contributions to this project.

  

## Overview

PANDORA is a Java application designed to facilitate the computation of chemical component transport in river systems. The acronym PANDORA itself encapsulates the key focus areas: **P**hosphorus, **A**lkalinity, **N**itrogen, and **D**issolved **O**xygen in **R**iverine and **A**quatic systems.

  

## Features

- **Comprehensive Calculations:** PANDORA calculation services provides algorithms for the determination of transport and transformations of phosphorus, alkalinity, nitrogen, and dissolved oxygen in river and aquatic environments.

- **User-Friendly Interface:** PANDORA web services provides an intuitive interface, to ease of use for both beginners and experienced researchers.

- **Versatile Application:** PANDORA is tailored to meet your diverse research needs; whether you are studying the impact of agricultural runoff, investigating water quality in aquatic ecosystems, or exploring other environmental scenarios,
